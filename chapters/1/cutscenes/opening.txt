-@cs:bg=war@@bgm=intro@It is said that long ago, before human feet had felt
the ground of distant stars, Earth was a dangerous place ruled by 
short-tempered warlords.
-As the centuries passed, the methods of these warlords' selection evolved,
but they remained short-sighted and belligerent even as their destructive power
grew ever greater.
-Eventually, they became powerful enough to end humanity altogether.
Generations were born, lived, worked, and died under the shadow of the
potential annihilation of their entire species.
-@cs:bg=launch_site@To counteract this threat, a group of scientists and 
engineers launched a secret project.
-They guarded the existence of this project closely for decades in order to
prevent the warlords from attempting to take control and use it to their own
advantage.
-At last, after lifetimes of collective labor, it was completed. In a sudden,
coordinated action, lightly guarded satellite launch facilities all over the
planet were captured.
-Before the world realized what was happening, trucks full of machinery swept
into the captured sites. Within hours, their contents assembled themselves into
massive space ships.
-Earth's warlords naturally all suspected each other of sabotage, and many
moved to destroy these mysterious ships before they could escape the planet.
Several were successfully intercepted.
-@cs:bg=planet@The survivors entered hibernation as their ships navigated them
toward their decades-distant destinations. Their new homes.
-If all went according to plan, they were to use local resources to construct
hyperspace beacons, allowing instantaneous transportation between the newly
settled planets.
-Once they were self-sufficient and in contact, they would open a beacon back
to Earth, allowing its inhabitants to flee to a new world if they were willing
to leave the old one behind.
-Seldom, of course, does all go according to plan.

-@cs:bg=bedroom@@bgm=lin@@addchar=Lin@@active=Lin@@expression=pained@Damn, it's
cold in here all of a sudden.
-@expression=thinking@Wait, no; it's not sudden at all, is it? We made it out of
the atmosphere, and then...
-So either we've made it or something's gone horribly wrong and I'm going to die
in space.
-I think the protocol we settled on was to go to the common room and see who
else woke up.
-@active=x@Lin forces her stiff muscles to stand and, eventually, floats to the 
common room at the end of the hall.

-@cs:bg=commonroom@@active=Lin@What, just you?
-@active=x@A short man floats gently from one side of the room to the other,
doing what can only be described as zero-G shadowboxing.
-@addchar=Peralta@@active=Peralta@Seems that way so far.
-@active=Lin@As I recall, there were supposed to be four of us up for the first
wave. You must be Peralta, the civil engineer?
-@active=Peralta@Ignacio Peralta, yes. And I recall from the previous two times
we've met that you're Interim Commander Lin.
-@active=Lin@@expression=pained@Ah, I thought you looked familiar. Sorry.
-@active=Peralta@It's fine. I'm sure you've had to meet hundreds of new people
over the past few months.
-The other two are Lyudmila Yezhova from bioengineering and Lukas Klein from 
agriculture. I haven't seen any sign of either one yet.
-@active=?@Well, I can fix half of that problem.
-@active=Peralta@Ah, I see you've survived as well.
-@addchar=Yezhova@@active=Yezhova@Looks like it, unless hell for me is just
what I was planning to do anyway.
-@active=Lin@@expression=neutral@Yezhova, would you mind waiting here for Klein
while Peralta and I check the instruments? We need to find out if we've really 
arrived.
-@active=Yezhova@Actually, I think I'll go and check on him directly. His pod
was in the first bank with ours, so if he's not here already he should be in the
fourth recovery room.
-@active=Lin@Perfect. We'll try to get the internal communications online, but 
if that doesn't work, plan to meet us on the bridge.
-@active=Yezhova@You got it.

-@cs:bg=bridge@ETAOIN SHRDLU@end@
