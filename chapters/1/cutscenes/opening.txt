-@cs:bg=war@@bgm=intro@It is said that long ago, before human feet had felt
the ground of distant stars, Earth was a dangerous place ruled by 
short-tempered warlords.
-As the centuries passed, the methods of these warlords' selection evolved,
but they remained short-sighted and belligerent even as their destructive power
grew ever greater.
-Eventually, they became powerful enough to end humanity altogether.
Generations were born, lived, worked, and died under the shadow of the
potential annihilation of their entire species.
-@cs:bg=launch_site@To counteract this threat, a group of scientists and 
engineers launched a secret project.
-They guarded the existence of this project closely for decades in order to
prevent the warlords from attempting to take control and use it to their own
advantage.
-At last, after lifetimes of collective labor, it was completed. In a sudden,
coordinated action, lightly guarded satellite launch facilities all over the
planet were captured.
-Before the world realized what was happening, trucks full of machinery swept
into the captured sites. Within hours, their contents assembled themselves into
massive space ships.
-Earth's warlords naturally all suspected each other of sabotage, and many
moved to destroy these mysterious ships before they could escape the planet.
Several were successfully intercepted.
-@cs:bg=planet@The survivors entered hibernation as their ships navigated them
toward their decades-distant destinations. Their new homes.
-If all went according to plan, they were to use local resources to construct
hyperspace beacons, allowing instantaneous transportation between the newly
settled planets.
-Once they were self-sufficient and in contact, they would open a beacon back
to Earth, allowing its inhabitants to flee to a new world if they were willing
to leave the old one behind.
-Seldom, of course, does all go according to plan.
